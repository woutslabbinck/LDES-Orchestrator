# LDES-Orchestrator
Fills the gaps that a Linked Data Platform (LDP) cannot do by itself for creating a Linked Data Event Stream (LDES) in LDP.

## How to use

```bash
npm install

npm run orchestrate
```

Currently it only does an authenticated fetch to tree.linkeddatfragments.org/announcements using the broker.pod.inrupt.com idp
